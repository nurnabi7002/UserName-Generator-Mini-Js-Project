# 👤 Username Generator — Mini JavaScript Project

A simple username generator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app takes a full name from the user, removes the spaces, converts it to lowercase, adds `@` at the beginning and appends the character count to the end to generate a unique username.
